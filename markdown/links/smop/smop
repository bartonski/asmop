SMOP
====

Concept
-------

SMOP stands for "Small Matter Of Programming".

Computer programming has a number of large challenges that lie outside of coding:

* Design of the program
* Determining the balance between abstracton and readability
* Keeping documentation up to date
* Creating re-usable code which gets used because people can find it
* Keeping implementations in different programming languages in synch
* Communicating the concepts about what the code is supposed to do

SMOP is a framework for creating software and libraries where the design, definition of abstract concepts and documentation -- both for new users and people seeking reference, are all located in a wiki-like tree of markdown formatted files. The structure and contents of this tree informs individual implementations of the software.

SMOP is intended to be lightweight and to provide enough structure to be useful, but not so much as to interfere with the implementation of software in different programming languages or environments.

Discovery Documentation
-----------------------

The SMOP software should take a template markdown file, copy it to a specified location, and create a link to it from an index file. The template contains the following sections:

Title
:    The name of the program or project being being documented.

Concept
:    The idea or group of ideas governing the software being developed -- The 'thing' in the phrase 'Do one thing well'.

Discovery Documentation
:    The entry point for new users of the software. After reading this section, a new user should have some idea of what the software is used for, where it fits in a larger framework, and where to get more detailed information.

Reference Documentation
:    The nuts and bolts documentation; it should cover any implemented API, and command line switches, applicable standards and known limitations

Test
:    A pointer to a TAP test suite that each implementation must pass

Implimentatons
:    A pointer to the implementation of the software in a variety of programming languages

Orthogonal Concepts
:    Related concepts, which should not be implimented in this software.
